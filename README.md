Project Key Concepts
Frontend Screenshots :
Frontend screenshots show the visual interface of the application, including dashboards,
forms, and data views. They help reviewers understand user experience, layout design,
and application flow. Screenshots provide proof that the frontend is working and user-
friendly.
API Endpoints List :
API endpoints define how the frontend communicates with the backend services. They
specify request methods (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.), URLs, and functionality. This
list helps developers and reviewers understand system integration and data flow.
Method Endpoint Description
GET /transactions Retrieve all transactions
POST /transactions Add a new transaction
GET /balance Get current balance
GET /prediction Get predicted future balance
DELETE /transactions/{id} Delete transaction by ID
Database Schema :
The database schema defines how data is structured, stored, and related in the system.
It includes tables, columns, data types, and relationships between data entities. A clear
schema ensures data consistency, scalability, and easy maintenance.
GitHub Repository :
The GitHub repository contains the complete project source code, documentation, and
version history. It allows teams and companies to review code quality, structure, and
implementation details. It also enables collaboration, issue tracking, and project deploy-
ment workflows.
